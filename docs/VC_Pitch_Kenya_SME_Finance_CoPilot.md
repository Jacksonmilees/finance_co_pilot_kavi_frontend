## Finance Growth Co‑Pilot — Kenya SME Pitch (Concise)

### 1) Problem
- Kenyan SMEs struggle with fragmented finance ops: M‑Pesa collections, bank transfers, invoicing, expense capture, and tax compliance live in silos.
- Manual reconciliation and month‑end close are slow and error‑prone; cash visibility is poor; access to working capital is limited.
- KRA eTIMS rollout increases compliance burden; most tools are not localized or are too complex/expensive.

### 2) Solution
- An AI‑powered finance co‑pilot that unifies collections, spend, invoicing, and compliance in one Kenya‑first workspace.
- Key modules:
  - M‑Pesa connect and auto‑reconciliation (Lipa na M‑Pesa/Till/Paybill, channel insights, settlement visibility)
  - e‑invoicing with KRA eTIMS readiness (templates, validation, audit trail)
  - Cashflow forecasting and runway with proactive alerts (WhatsApp/email)
  - Invoice-to-cash acceleration (reminders, early‑pay discounts, financing partner handoffs)
  - Credit‑readiness insights and lender‑grade financials
  - Voice/Chat (KAVI) to answer “What’s my runway?”, “Who owes me this week?”, “Prepare e‑invoice for X”

### 3) Why Now
- 95%+ mobile money penetration (M‑Pesa dominant) + accelerating digitization of SMEs
- KRA eTIMS mandate forces digital compliance and e‑invoice adoption
- Banks/fintechs seeking cleaner SME data for lending and embedded finance partnerships

### 4) Market (Kenya initial wedge → EAC expansion)
- ~7.4M MSMEs; formalizing and digitizing fast; initial beachhead: formal SMEs with M‑Pesa sales and invoicing
- Expansion to retail/services across EAC; API‑led approach eases new country adds (tax + payments adaptors)

### 5) Product Highlights (current build)
- Role‑based dashboards (User, Business Admin, Super Admin) with KES‑first formatting
- Transactions hub with search, date range filters, CSV export, and KPI stats
- M‑Pesa and KRA eTIMS setup CTAs embedded in dashboards for activation and compliance readiness
- AI assistant (KAVI) for natural‑language finance queries and guidance

### 6) Differentiation
- Kenya‑first: deep M‑Pesa workflows, KRA eTIMS readiness, local currency/UX
- AI co‑pilot front‑and‑center (not an afterthought): proactive risk/compliance/cash alerts
- Lender‑ready data model: invoice aging, DSO, margin insights to unlock working capital
- Fast time‑to‑value: connect, reconcile, and see insights in <24 hours

### 7) Competitive Landscape
- Global: QuickBooks/Xero/Zoho (broad accounting; limited local integrations), Brex/Ramp (US‑centric), Wave
- Kenya/East Africa: Kopo Kopo (merchant services), PesaPal/Flutterwave (payments), small POS suites (Duka/POS vendors)
- Our edge: unify M‑Pesa reconciliation + e‑invoicing + AI cashflow co‑pilot with lender‑grade outputs

### 8) Business Model
- SaaS: Free (view/reconcile) → Pro (automation, e‑invoices, analytics) → Growth (multi‑entity, approvals, API)
- Add‑ons: payments (M‑Pesa fees share), invoice financing affiliate/referral, premium support

### 9) Go‑To‑Market
- Channel partners: accountants, POS vendors, M‑Pesa aggregators, micro‑lenders/SACCOs
- Bottom‑up self‑serve onboarding with WhatsApp‑assisted nudges
- Vertical playbooks (retail, services, agencies) with templates and benchmarks

### 10) Early KPIs (targets for first 6 months)
- Activation: ≥60% connect M‑Pesa within 7 days; ≥50% issue first e‑invoice within 14 days
- Efficiency: Month‑end close time −50%; unidentified transactions −70%
- Revenue: ARPU KES 1,500–3,000/mo; 20% attach on Pro by day 30

### 11) Product Roadmap (next 2–3 quarters)
- Q1: Direct M‑Pesa STK/Daraja v2 improvements, bank feeds (PesaLink), WhatsApp mini‑assistant
- Q2: Automated eTIMS submissions, invoice financing marketplace, multi‑currency
- Q3: Vendor bills OCR, approvals, advanced budgeting, tax packs for lenders and KRA

### 12) The Ask
- Raise $X pre‑seed/seed to finalize payments/eTIMS adaptors, expand sales/partners, and reach first 2,000 paying SMEs.
- Intros to: M‑Pesa aggregators, leading SME lenders, and accountant networks.
